# Image filtering through algorithm manipulation
## Q3 Galvanize project (Rob, Tommy, Paris)
The objective of this project is to create an online tool for image filtering and generation through the use of algorithms

### Program features
The program will allow the following actions:
- Open images from the hard drive
- Open images from a URL
- Be able to select between two options. Applying filters to an image or generating "art"
- save the modified or generated image in the hard drive
- allow user to specify the parameters used to generate the algoritmic art

The features that the program needs to offer are:
- Create a negative of the imported image
- Edge detection
- Create art through algorithm implementation

Nice to have features:
- Zooming of the image
- Be able to select on the parameters of the filtering
- drag bars that allow the different feature changes

### Notes
Items to research:
- Research on how to use the `<canvas>` tag in order to manipulate images wrapped around it
